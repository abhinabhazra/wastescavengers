How amI contributing to the waste problem? How are we managing our waste? Can waste be a resource? How can our waste management practices be more sustainable?</p>

          <h1>Waste Scavenger Hunt Worksheet</h1>
          <p>The activity started off by assigning each student a classroom which they were to examine. After seeking permission for the teachers, each students thoroughly examined each designated room, taking careful note of the location and material of the waste. Each student made observations and notes based on the type of waste, volume of the waste and where the waste was kept. Key locations such as the staffroom, canteen and school kitchen were also covered. The students were able to find that the type of waste varied between different locations and that areas such as staffroom and school kitchen were cleaner that the classrooms. Classrooms that had younger students had more variety of waste as compared to classes of older students. This activity gave the students insight on the different types of waste. It was also observed that more waste was produced at school than in individual households, where the students were able to come the conclusion that as there are more people in schools, more waste gets produced.

            Is it when you no longer need it? Or is it when a product is broken or somehow spoilt?</h2>
           <br>
          <p>An object can become waste when it is no longer needed or when it is broken. An object that is no longer needed by an individual will no be used and would take up and clutter spaces. This waste is only waste to the owner, and it can rid itself of the waste label when in the hands of someone who would actually put the product into use. However, an object that is broken cannot be used efficiently in that state. It can be reused into a different purpose either by the owner or by giving it to someone how can repurpose or recycle it by altering it in some way.

          <h2> Do you think everything you listed was actually waste? Why or why not?</h2>
           <br>
          <p> We believe that everything that we listed was not waste and could easily be used for various other tasks. Some of the wastes we saw were used paper, and waste fruit bits. The eaten fruits could easily be utilised for making compost, through which one can easily grow plants. In this modern generation, people could easily reuse their old paper to create new sheets using very basic tools. Various other materials like plastic bottles too, have a plethora of benefits and can be reused for keeping food, making reusable stationary holders and a myriad more. Other than that, many students throw their pens and do not refill their inks either. This in turn leads to a lot of plastic usage, increasing the trash on our planet earth. In conclusion, most of the times, people do not use materials to their full potential and throw them at an early stage. Hence, all materials that we throw are not garbage.

          <h2>Do you think that some of the things that you might throw away could be of value to someone else?</h2>
            <br>
          <p>Yes. Today, people throw their wastes without giving thought to the fact that one man’s trash can be another man’s treasure. notebooks and books which sometimes have empty unused pages are thrown by both students and teachers, without them realising that these books can be used to a larger extent. If these unused pages are torn and made into new books, many underprivileged children can have a cheaper access to educational materials. Other than that, the old rags people throw can be restitched into new clothes. These clothes can be given to the poor so they can have something to wear during harsh climate changes. Most of the times, people also throw away food which is untouched. Restraints throw away tons of food because it is not sold, and all of it goes to waste. If this food is given to beggars, world hunger can be resolved to such a vast level. In a nutshell, our trash that we throw will most of the time be of use to others. This is because most of the things we buy today have multiple uses and can easily be reused for ecological safety and an eco-friendly environment.

          <h2> Define Littering  </h2>
           <br>
          <p> Littering is the act of improperly disposing of waste or garbage in public spaces, such as throwing trash on the ground instead of using designated bins or recycling facilities. It causes environmental pollution and can be harmful to wildlife and ecosystems. As according to the form we can see that in our almost all the waste is in the bin.

          <h2>If you did the Waste Scavenger Hunt at home, were the results the same as those you got at school/college?</h2>
            <br>
          <p> At home, there is a wide range of waste produced, whereas at school, the waste is usually limited to school supplies with the occasional outlier. The amount of waste found in school is also vastly larger than that of a home. At home, people practice more mindfulness of where their waste goes and ensure it is disposed of. Whether it is the residents or a maid, on average, homes are better kept.
